HTTP :
HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol & it is used in client-server communication.
By using HTTP user sends the request to the server & the server sends the response to the user.

Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP/1.1 :
1. The users works on the textual format.
2. There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until 
   it doesnâ€™t get its all resources.
3. It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages.
4. It compresses data by itself.
5. The first problem is HTTP/1.1 transfer all the requests & responses in the plain text message form.

HTTP/2 : 
1. It works on the binary protocol.
2. It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.
3. It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages.
4. It uses HPACK for data compression.
5. The server sends all the other files like CSS & JS without the request of the client using the PUSH frame.
